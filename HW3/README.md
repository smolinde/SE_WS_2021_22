## HW3: Java Implementation of UML State Machine Diagram
#### This is the template project for implementing State Machine in Java for the Elevator example (refer to HW3 Task sheet). 
#### Task: 
 - Add the missing elements to complete the program and then run it! 
 - The default current_floor is 5th; run the program once with the destination floor higher, lower, and equal with the 5th floor and assess the program's behavior! 
##### Hint: print the state of the system whenever a transition happens, so the program will demonstrate moving of the elevator from a floor to another! :relieved:
